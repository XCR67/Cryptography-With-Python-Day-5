# Cryptography-With-Python-Day-5
Dedicated to showing how asymmetric works and how its key pairs can be used to encrypt for differing purposes. The code for this was gotten from "RSA Private & Public Key Encryption in Python" by NueralNine. This is because asymmetric on its own is too complex a topic to code from scratch. Likewise the code for AES was gotten from "Professional Data Encryption in Python" also by NueralNine, for the same reason being that AES is far too complex to create from scratch within a day.
